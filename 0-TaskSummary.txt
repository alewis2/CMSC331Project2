////// TASKS /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
---[Business Use Cases]--------------------------
Time sensitive: 11/25 (email only)

	Essentially a diagram of how the website works.........?

	   [Issues to consider]
		- Will need to go through old code, see what works and what doesn't,
		  how the pages interact with each other, etc.
		 (Should we scrap/redo any parts to make it better, or just 
		  work off of what's already there?)

		- Ask Lupoli for email...? Who do we contact, Lupoli or the client?



---[Advisor side: Choose student ]----------------
	- For every new appointment, 
	   allow advisor to book appointment with specific student 

	   [Issues to consider]
		- Choosing student: UMBC ID based, Name based, or email based?
		- Should it have validation for if the student exists in database or no?
		- What happens if that student already has a meeting?


---[Advisor side: View/edit different advisor's schedule ]
	- Allow advisor to view a different advisor's schedule 
	  and print, cancel, etc.

           [Issues to consider]
	  	- Does a advisor really need to be able to edit another
		  advisor's schedule??? Seems kinda shady
         	  (I can't really think of a reason why this is essential)

		- Would there be a need for permissions? Or is it free-for-all
		  (One advisor allows the other to access their schedule)


---[CSS revision]---------------------------------
	- Make sure all pages have external CSS.

	   [Issues to consider]
		-Some pages have unique or conflicting internal CSS.
		  (Do we compile these into a separate external css sheet?)

		-Should we change the original CSS at all?
		  (Unify design, remove redundancies across pages, etc)


---[Other Improvements]---------------------------------
	- See: Project 2 Resources folder for more.

	       There's a lot that the client wants/wishes for which may-or-may-not
	       already be implemented in the code we were given.
	       Not everything in this folder is a requirement (I am assuming) but
	       fulfilling them may get us a greater grade.


---[Documentation]---------------------------------
	- Document EVERYTHING
	- Make diagrams, website flow chart, screenshots
	- Videos/gifs of working website (once everything is finalized)
	- Comment functions/utility (within pages + external documentation/readme)


---[Presentation]----------------------------------
	- Essentially, take everything from documentation and present it concisely.
	- Powerpoint......?
	- Meeting at: ITE 240, 12/20 or 12/21 (choose date)

	[Requires]
	a. 20 min presentation + 5 min question time
		- give live demo of working project within first few minutes
		- then, talk about what we did, improved upon, etc (Powerpoint?)
		- be prepared to answer questions.

	b. Professional appearance; at most, business casual wear
	c. Slick Sheet, a one page advertisement of Project with:
		- brief description
		- what we did
		- highlight of good parts
		- screenshots/images (does not need color)
		- More layman/advertising/client oriented, less technical/backend
		- URL to working project
		- Three copies of this sheet

	d. Whole project on thumb drive to give to instructor
		- do...do we get the thumb drive back or........
