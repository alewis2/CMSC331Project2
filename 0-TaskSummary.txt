////// TASKS /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
---[General Issues]-------------------------------------
	- Overall testing to make sure everything works

---[Front page: Embed video + other small things]
	- Embed the video from the email to the front page.
	  Not difficult, but gotta figure out where to put it without making it
	  cluttered.


---[Advisor side: View/edit different advisor's schedule ]
	- Allow advisor to view a different advisor's schedule 
	  and print, cancel, etc.

           [Issues to consider]
	  	- Does a advisor really need to be able to edit another
		  advisor's schedule??? Seems kinda shady
         	  (I can't really think of a reason why this is essential)

		- Would there be a need for permissions? Or is it free-for-all
		  (One advisor allows the other to access their schedule)


---[Other Improvements]---------------------------------
	- See: Project 2 Resources folder for more.

	       There's a lot that the client wants/wishes for which may-or-may-not
	       already be implemented in the code we were given.
	       Not everything in this folder is a requirement (I am assuming) but
	       fulfilling them may get us a greater grade.


---[Documentation]---------------------------------
	- Document EVERYTHING
	- Make diagrams, website flow chart, screenshots
	- Videos/gifs of working website (once everything is finalized)
	- Comment functions/utility (within pages + external documentation/readme)


---[Presentation]----------------------------------
	- Essentially, take everything from documentation and present it concisely.
	- Powerpoint......?
	- Meeting at: ITE 240, 12/20 at 1:30pm

	[Requires]
	a. 20 min presentation + 5 min question time
		- give live demo of working project within first few minutes
		- then, talk about what we did, improved upon, etc (Powerpoint?)
		- be prepared to answer questions.

	b. Professional appearance; at most, business casual wear
	c. Slick Sheet, a one page advertisement of Project with:
		- brief description
		- what we did
		- highlight of good parts
		- screenshots/images (does not need color)
		- More layman/advertising/client oriented, less technical/backend
		- URL to working project
		- Three copies of this sheet

	d. Whole project on thumb drive to give to instructor
		- do...do we get the thumb drive back or........
		
	


////// FINISHED TASKS /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

---[Business Use Cases]--------------------------
Time sensitive: 11/25 (email only)
	Done. Visual diagram sent to Lupoli (Erika)

---[Advisor side: Choose student ]----------------
Make sure advisor can choose a specific student via their ID when making an appointment
	Done.
	May require some testing.

---[CSS revision]---------------------------------
	Done.
	All pages (including work-order forms) now have consistent CSS from
	external stylesheet.

---[Advisor side: Fixing password/login issue]----
Fix issue with admin password/login.
	Done.
	What was happening was that when creating a new advisor, their
	password was being stored in the database with the wrong (unhashed) form.
